- PROBLEMS: I can update an answer row for a user, but only one row. If I log out and
try another user, it works for that user too, but as with the other one, it only
takes the last value that was answered. Also, the questions ID stays at one, I
think that's part of the problem. Not sure how to get it to change with the questions
ID, as I am already passing it through as a paramater.
