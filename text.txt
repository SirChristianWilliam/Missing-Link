- PROBLEMS: I can update an answer row for a user, but only one row. If I log out and
try another user, it works for that user too, but as with the other one, it only
takes the last value that was answered. Also, the questions ID stays at one, I
think that's part of the problem. Not sure how to get it to change with the questions
ID, as I am already passing it through as a paramater.

WHAT I NEED TO DO TO GET MY APP RUNNING WITH BASE MODE:
1. Update the user's answer on the questions page.
2. Results page must show the condition's questions/answer pairs for ALL users
3. Results page must show a number of matches if there are duplicate answers for
    the same question amongst all users.
4. In results page, when condition is saved, it should be added to the profile page
    list. All it needs to do is provide a link with that conditions' name to get back
        to the results page. 
5. Profile page needs to be able to EDIT the username of the user. 
6. Profile page condition needs to be able to be DELETED.
7. Results page needs to add a code, and if it matches with a condition, it will
    display a success message and the user's question/answers will be added to the
    condition's dataset of questions/answers. Any duplicate answers for the same
    question will just increase the count # of that question's ID, in the "occurs" 
    table column. 
8. Show a checkmark next to the condition on the profile page that you have an access
    key synced up for. 

HOW TO ADD/GET DATA FROM THE TABLES:
1. First, user's answers will all be saved to the answers table.
2. This data will be huge, but the user's ID will make it so I can sort
    through it by the user's ID. 
3. Results page will need to access that data. Each individual condition
     will only accept data where the USER'S ACCESS KEY matches the CONDITION KEY 
     for the condition that is being shown. To make that easier to understand,
     it's basically 
        SELECT "questions","answers" FROM "answers"
        JOIN "conditions"
        ON "conditions"."id" = "questions"."id"
        JOIN "user"
        ON "user"."id" = "answers"."id"
        WHERE "user"."key" == "condition"."key" AND
        "condition"."name" == (current condition);
